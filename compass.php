						<h1>Compass Portfolios</h1>
						<p>The Compass Portfolio range offers investors a choice of global, risk-targeted multi-asset funds which are actively managed by the multi-asset team at Old Mutual Wealth’s Investment Division.

						The portfolios are truly globalised with no specific regional biases. They can be ideal solutions for clients who are seeking to diversify their investments over multiple markets, sectors, assets and investment styles. Each portfolio is a basket of assets packaged within a single fund, representing a highly diversified portfolio of global stocks and shares, alternatives, fixed interest and cash.

						The Old Mutual Compass Portfolio Range is available to our customers through our OMI Isle of Man and OMI Ireland products. Please see the table at the bottom of the page for details.</p>
						
						<h2>Why choose the Compass Portfolio range?</h2>
						<p>One of the key benefits of investing in a diversified multi-asset portfolio is that they can offer a smoother overall investment journey as different asset classes usually have different return behaviours. This is a proven way to spread risk and could help protect your client’s money during periods when markets are performing poorly. Clients can also switch between portfolios as their investment needs change over time which can help ensure their investments are aligned with their needs and objectives.</p>
